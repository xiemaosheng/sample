2016-09-04 15:59:00  9843 [localhost-startStop-1] WARN  org.springframework.context.annotation.ConfigurationClassEnhancer:348  - @Bean method WebMvcConfig.getPropertyConfigurer is non-static and returns an object assignable to Spring's BeanFactoryPostProcessor interface. This will result in a failure to process annotations such as @Autowired, @Resource and @PostConstruct within the method's declaring @Configuration class. Add the 'static' modifier to this method to avoid these container lifecycle issues; see @Bean javadoc for complete details.
